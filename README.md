# voice-sos
#This is a small android application, which is based on voice recognition. 
#It runs a voice recognition service in the background, which continues to take voice inputs, even when phone is 
#in idle #state
#It checks for a specific string(s) in the voice input, the application could send messages to specific phone 
#numbers(both configurable).

#settings options:
#Phone number -> destination phone number (the appllication will not start unless the phone number is entered)
#Message -> The message to be sent (the default is "help me")
#voice SOS -> The text string to be searched for (default is "help")

#This is based upon the language pack installed for offline voice search options on the phone, at present it works
# for "en-us"
